1. Show that (algebraically) in the absence of censoring $\hat S_{{\tiny \mbox{KM}}}(t)=\hat S_{\mbox{e}}(t)$.

2. In the absence of censoring, show that the Greenwood Formula (page 30 on note 2) can be reduced to $$\frac{\hat S_{{\tiny \mbox{KM}}}(t) \times \{ 1 - \hat S_{{\tiny \mbox{KM}}}(t)\}}{n}.$$
You might assume there are no ties among the observations.

3. Consider the Leukemia data from the `survival` package: \label{aml}
    ```{r aml}
    library(survival)
    head(aml)
    ```
    In here, each row represent one patient. `aml` is the observed survival time, `status` is the censoring indicator (1 = event, 0 = censored), and `x` is the treatment indicator. We will ignore the treatment indicator for now.
    a. Plot the Kaplan-Meier survival curve for the data. \label{aml:surv}
    b. Add the Nelson-Aalen survival curve to the Kaplan-Meier plot from \eqref{aml:surv}. 
    
4. The expected survival time for the Leukemia data in \#\eqref{aml} does not exist because the last observation is a censored event.
    An alternative is to lookInstead of looking at the expected survival time, an alternative is to look at the restricted mean survival time.
    Compute $E(T|T<161)$ based on the survival curve in \eqref{aml:surv}.
    
5. Let $N_i(t)$ be the number of events over time interval $(0, t]$ for the $i$th patient in \#\eqref{aml}. Let $N(t)=\sum_{i=1}^nN_i(t)$ be the aggregated counting process.
    a. Plot $N(t)$.
    b. Plot $M(t)$, where $M(t) = N(t) - \hat H(t)$ and $\hat H(t)$ is the Nelson-Aalen estimator for the cumulative hazard function. \label{Mt}
    
    * Note on \ref{Mt}: After giving some thought, I think it is more meaningful to plot $dM(t)=dN(t)- \hat h(t)dt$. Both plots will receive full credit for \ref{Mt}.
