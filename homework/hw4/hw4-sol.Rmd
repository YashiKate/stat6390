1. \textbf{Survival of root canal filled teeth} 
Deep caries or restorations in teeth could lead to pulpal involvement, necessitating root canal therapy or extraction. In a retrospective dental study, the primary interest is to assess the impact of pulpal involvement on tooth survival. In this data analysis, a Cox model is fitted using the survival time of the teeth as the response variable. The covariates included in the model are 
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{MOLAR} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{molar tooth}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{matrix}\right.\,\,  
\mbox{ROOT} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{root canal treatment applied}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{matrix}\right. \,\,\,\,
\end{aligned}
$$
and three mutually exclusive categories of proximal contacts
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{PC1} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{nonbridge abutment with one proximal contacts}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{matrix}\right.
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{PC2} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{nonbridge abutment with two proximal contacts}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{matrix}\right. 
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\mbox{PCABUT} = \left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{bridge abutment}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{matrix}\right. \,\,
\end{aligned}
$$
and the number of pockets larger than 5 mm (POCKET). 
Use the attached the `coxph` output to answer the following questions:

a. **(2 points) Suppose the log-partial likelihood for the model is -581.4417, what is the log-partial likelihood for the reduced model with no covariates?**

    The reduced log-partial likelihood can be obtained by solving $G = 2 \cdot\{\ell_p(\widehat\beta) - \ell_p(0)\}$, e.g., `-581.4417 - 97.66 / 2 = ``r -581.4417 - 97.66 / 2`

b. **(2 points) What is the hazard ratio that compares teeth with bridge abutment with those without? \label{pocket}**

    The hazard ratio is 0.5941, indicating that patients with bridge abutment have lower (though not significant) risk of tooth loss.
  
c. **(2 points) What is the 95\% confidence interval for the hazard ratio in \#\ref{pocket}?**

    The 95\% confidence interval is $(-0.5207 - 1.96\times0.5114, -0.5207 + 1.96\times0.5114) = (0.218, 1.619)$. The confidence interval includes 1 indicating the covariate effect is not significant at $\alpha = 0.05$.
    
d. **(2 points) What is the hazard ratio that compares teeth with nonbridge abutment and one proximal contacts with those with nonbridge abutment and two proximal contacts?** 

    The fitted hazard for patients with nonbridge abutment and one proximal contacts is $e^{-0.7587 - 0.5207}$ and the fitted hazard for patients with nonbridge abutment and two proximal contacts is $e^{-1.5423 - 0.5207}$. These implies that the hazard ratio is $e^{-0.7585 + 1.5423} \approx 2.1893$. The result indicates that patients with nonbridge abutment and one proximal contacts tend to have a higher risk of tooth loss than those with nonbridge abutment and two proximal contacts.

e. **(2 points) What is the hazard ratio that compares molar teeth with non-molar teeth **among those underwent root canal treatment**?**

    Simple calculation gives the hazard ratio of $e^{-0.8440+0.6645}\approx 0.8357$, which indicates that patients non-molar teeth are more vulnerable when compare to the root canal counterpart.
