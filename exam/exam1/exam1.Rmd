1. Use the complete *WHAS100* dataset and gender as the group indicator, 
compute the log-rank statistic, $Q$, presented as Equation (9) on page 60 of note 2 with $\omega_i = 1$.
Use $Q$ to compute a $p$-value to test the null hypothesis of $H_o: S_0(t) = S_1(t)$.
Do this **without a software package** (6 pts), and verify the calculation with `survdiff` (4 pts).

\newpage
2. There are many ways to form a basis for survival curve comparison. \label{stats}
Here are some:
    a. The numerator term in $Q$ without the square:
    $$D_1 = \sum_{i = 1}^D\{d_{1i} - E(d_{1i})\}.$$
    b. The largest distance between the two curves:
    $$D_2 = \max|S_1(t) - S_0(t)|.$$
    d. The difference between the median survival times:
    $$D_3 = S_1^{-1}(0.5) - S_0^{-1}(0.5)$$
    d. The difference between the mean survival times:
    $$D_4 = \int_0^{t_{(n)}} \{S_1(u) - S_0(u)\}\,du,$$ where $t_{(n)}$ is the maximum observed survival time.
    
    \flushleft Compute each of the above statistic for the $WHAS100$ dataset (5 pts $\times4$).

\newpage   
3. The statistics computed in \eqref{stats} do not provide meaningful interpretations when standing along. 
We will use a permutation approach to test for the null hypothesis of $H_o: S_0(t) = S_1(t)$ based on these statistics.
The idea of a permutation test is simple. The general procedure can be summarized into the following steps:
    i. Compute the desired statistic based on the observed data; we will call this the observed statistic.
    ii. Permute the data under the null.
    iii. Compute the statistics for each possible permutation in Step ii.; we will call these permutation statistics.
    iv. Draw conclusion based on where the observed statistic stands among the permutation statistics.
\newline

    \flushleft
The statistics we computed in \eqref{stats} are the observed statistics in Step i.
If the null hypothesis of $H_o: S_0(t) = S_1(t)$ is true, 
then one can randomly shuffle the group indicator to generate different permutations (Step ii) and the statistics for these permutations should be similar (Step iii).
\newline

    \flushleft
    a. (5 pts$\times4$) Generate 5000 permutation and, for each of the permutation, compute the four statistics presented in \eqref{stats}.
    We will call the permutated statistics $D_{1i}^*$, $D^*_{2i}$, $D^*_{3i}$ and $D^*_{4i}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, 5000$.
    Create a histgram for these permutated statistics and print the `summary`.
    \flushleft
    b. (5 pts$\times4$) Compute the $p$-value based on these statistics by 
    $$p = 2\cdot\frac{\min(N_1, N_2)}{5000}, $$
    where $N_1 = \#\{D \ge D^*\}$, $N_2 = \#\{D\le D^*\}$, and $\#$ means the "number of", e.g., $N_1$ is the number of these permutated statistics less than or equal to the observed statistic.

\newpage   
4. Another method to compare two survival curves is to consider a sign test. 
Suppose we have two groups of uncensored survival times:

      \flushleft Males: $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{n_0}$.
      \flushleft Females: $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n_1}$.

      \flushleft
The sign test looks at the statistic
$$ U = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_0}\sum_{j = 1}^{n_1}\mbox{sgn}(x_i - y_j),$$
where $\mbox{sgn}(\cdot)$ is the sign function. 
In the pretense of right censoring, survival times can not be compared directly and a modified version of $U = \sum_{i = 1}^{n_0}\sum_{j = 1}^{n_1}U_{ij}$ is considered, where
$$U_{ij}=\left\{\begin{matrix}
1 & \mbox{if } x_i > y_j, y_j \mbox{ is uncersored.}\\
-1 & \mbox{if } x_i < y_j, x_i \mbox{ is uncersored.}\\ 
0 & \mbox{otherwise.} 
\end{matrix}\right.$$

    a. (5 pts) Compute $U$ for the WHAS100 dataset.
    b. (5 pts) Create a histgram for these permutated statistics and print the `summary`. Obtain a permutation $p$-value based on 5000 permutations.
