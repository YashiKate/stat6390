# The i386 error message
Some of you (especially these with Windows machines) ran into error messages along the lines of
```{}
*** arch - i386
ERROR: compilation failed for package 'survMisc'
```
Similar issues are reported [here](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/issues/2319), [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/issues/165), and more.
A workaround approach is to run the following codes before the command line that produce the error message:
```{R eval = FALSE}
library(devtools)
assignInNamespace("version_info", c(devtools:::version_info, list("3.5" = list(version_min = "3.3.0", version_max = "99.99.99", path = "bin"))), "devtools")
```
See [here](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/issues/1772) for the original discussion.
This enable `Rtools` package to be used alongside `devtools`.
However, this is only a temporary fix, and the user might need to run this line every time `devtools` is loaded. 

A possible reason for this issue is that `Rtools` is not being detected or not installed properly. 
For this, the user can try to install `Rtools` for windows from this [link](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).
Make sure to check "**add rtools to system PATH**":

# Adding a data point 
In one of the class example, we plotted the empirical survival curve with: 
```{R load, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(survival)
load("whas100.RData")
```

```{R data}
whas100 %>% filter(fstat > 0) %>% mutate(surv = 1 - ecdf(lenfol)(lenfol)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(lenfol, surv)) + geom_step()
```

The codes can be modified in the following way so that the empirical survival curve starts from $\hat{S}_e(0)= 1$.
```{R tian}
whas100 %>% filter(fstat > 0) %>% mutate(surv = 1 - ecdf(lenfol)(lenfol)) %>% 
  add_row(lenfol = 0, surv = 1,.before = 1) %>% ggplot(aes(lenfol, surv)) + 
  geom_step() + labs(title = "Codes provided by Tian Jiang")
```

The following example produces the similar plot without the need to store $\hat{S}_e(t)$ in `surv`.
```{R easy}
whas100 %>% filter(fstat > 0) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lenfol)) + geom_step(aes(y = 1 - ..y..), stat = "ecdf", show.legend = TRUE) +
  ylab("surv")
```

Here we have $\hat{S}_e(t) = 1$ for $t < 6$ and $\hat{S}_e(t) = 0$ for $t \ge 2710$.

# Generate $\{1, -1, \ldots, 1\}$ 
Suppose we want to generate the sequence $\{1, -1, \ldots, -1, 1\}$ with 10 1's and 9 -1's (the vector then has length = 19).
Here are some possible approaches:
```{R sequence}
(-1)^(0:18)
diff(0:19 %% 2)
diff(rep(0:1, 10))
rep(c(1, -1), 10)[1:19]
ifelse(1:19 %% 2, 1, -1)
```
